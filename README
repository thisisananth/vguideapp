~~ This is an application I am writing to scratch my own itch ~~
I feel we will be more productive if we plan the day. 
We can only go according to plan if we focus and if we are realistic in our planning.
 I want to create an application which will help in these three things.
 It is not a do-it-all application. Its purpose is specific. 

Decide: At the beginning of the day, you will be asked to decide three things which you want to do today. 

Track: At various times of the day, you will be notified to keep track of your progress 

Celebrate: If you feel de-motivated you can always see the items you have completed and celebrate. 

~~ Development ~~
I am learning Django and hence wanted to program it in Django.
 As I am learning and doing it, progress might be slow.
 If you are interested in collaborating on the project, you are most welcome.
 If you have ideas to improve it or want to help in development or help in design,
 please send me an email at thisisananth@gmail.com
